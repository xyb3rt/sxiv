**Simple X Image Viewer**

sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv. Its only dependencies besides xlib are
imlib2, libexif and giflib. The primary goal for writing sxiv is to create an
image viewer, which only has the most basic features required for fast image
viewing (the ones I want). It has vi key bindings and works nicely with tiling
window managers.  Its code base should be kept small and clean to make it easy
for you to dig into it and customize it for your needs.


Features
--------

* Basic image operations, e.g. zooming, panning, rotating
* Customizable key and mouse button mappings (in *config.h*)
* Thumbnail mode: grid of selectable previews of all images
* Ability to cache thumbnails for fast re-loading
* Basic support for multi-frame images
* Load all frames from GIF files and play GIF animations
* Display image information in status bar

**Thumbnail mode:**

![Thumb](http://muennich.github.com/sxiv/img/thumb.png "Thumb mode")


Installation
------------

sxiv is built using the commands:

    $ make
    # make install

Please note, that the latter one requires root privileges.
By default, sxiv is installed using the prefix "/usr/local", so the full path
of the executable will be "/usr/local/bin/sxiv".

You can install sxiv into a directory of your choice by changing the second
command to:

    # make PREFIX="/your/dir" install

The build-time specific settings of sxiv can be found in the file *config.h*.
Please check and change them, so that they fit your needs.
If the file *config.h* does not already exist, then you have to create it with
the following command:

    $ make config.h


Usage
-----

sxiv has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is
image mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid
of small previews is displayed, making it easy to choose an image to open.

**Command line options:**

    -a           Play animations of multi-frame images
    -b           Do not show info bar on bottom of window
    -c           Remove all orphaned cache files from thumbnail cache and exit
    -f           Start in fullscreen mode
    -G GAMMA     Set image gamma to GAMMA (-32..32)
    -g GEOMETRY  Set window position and size
                 (see section GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS of X(7))
    -i           Read file list from stdin
    -N NAME      Set X window resource name to NAME
    -n NUM       Start at picture NUM
    -o           Write list of marked files to stdout when quitting
    -q           Be quiet, disable warnings
    -r           Search given directories recursively for images
    -R           Randomize images in slideshow mode
    -S DELAY     Enable slideshow and set slideshow delay to DELAY seconds
    -s MODE      Set scale mode to MODE ([d]own, [f]it, [w]idth, [h]eight)
    -t           Start in thumbnail mode
    -v           Print version information and exit
    -Z           Same as `-z 100'
    -z ZOOM      Set zoom level to ZOOM percent

    M            Reverse all image marks
    Ctrl-m       Remove all image marks
