# Example for $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/key-handler
# Called by sxiv(1) when you press the prefix key (C-x by default) followed by
# a key combo. The key combo is passed as its first argument and the path of
# the current image as its second argument.
# sxiv(1) blocks until this script terminates. It then checks if the image
# has been modified and reloads it.

# The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY",
# where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X
# keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the "XK_" prefix.
