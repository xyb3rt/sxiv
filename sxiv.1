.SH STATUS BAR
The information displayed on the left side of the status bar can be replaced
with the output of a user-provided script, which is called by sxiv whenever an
image gets loaded. The path of this script is
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/image-info
and the first argument to this script is the path of the loaded image. The
second and third arguments are the width and height of the picture. The fourth
is the rank of the picture and and the fifth the total number of pcitures.
.P
There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/image-info .
.SH EXTERNAL KEY HANDLER
Additional external keyboard commands can be defined using a handler program
located in
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
The handler is invoked by pressing
.BR Ctrl-x .
The next key combo is then passed as its first argument and the path of the
current image as its second argument.  sxiv(1) will block until the handler
terminates. It then checks if the image has been modified and reloads it.

The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY",
where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X
keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the "XK_" prefix.

There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
sxiv stores all thumbnails under
.IR $XDG_CACHE_HOME/sxiv/ .
.P
Use the command line option
.I \-c
to remove all orphaned cache files. Additionally, run the following command
afterwards inside the cache directory to remove empty subdirectories:
.P
.RS
find . \-depth \-type d \-empty ! \-name '.' \-exec rmdir {} \\;
