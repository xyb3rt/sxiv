.SH DESCRIPTION
sxiv is a simple image viewer for X. It only has the most basic features
required for fast image viewing.
.P
sxiv has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image
mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of 
small previews is displayed, making it easy to choose an image to open.

.SH STATUS BAR
The information displayed on the left side of the status bar can be replaced
with the output of a user-provided script, which is called by sxiv whenever an
image gets loaded. The path of this script is
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/image-info
and the first argument to this script is the path of the loaded image.
.P
There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/image-info .
.SH EXTERNAL KEY HANDLER
Additional keyboard commands can be defined using a handler program
located in
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
You can invoke the handler by pressing
.B Ctrl-x
and then a key combo that will be passed to the handler. The key combo
is passed as its first argument and the path of the current image as
its second argument.  sxiv(1) will block until handler terminates. It
then checks if the image has been modified and reloads it.

The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY",
where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X
keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the "XK_" prefix.

There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
To enable thumbnail caching, please make sure to create the directory
.I $XDG_CACHE_HOME/sxiv/
with write permissions. sxiv will then store all thumbnails inside this
directory, but it will not create this directory by itself. It rather uses the
existance of this directory as an affirmation, that the user wants thumbnails
to be cached.
.P
Use the command line option
.I \-c
to keep the cache directory clean by removing all orphaned cache files.
Additionally, run the following command afterwards inside the cache directory
to remove empty subdirectories:
.P
.RS
find . \-depth \-type d \-empty ! \-name '.' \-exec rmdir {} \\;
